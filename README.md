# OrigamiPaint
This project started out as a present for a friend, but I ended up having more ideas with regards to what could be done next. Erik Demaine et al. have a nice origami simulator that can use the patterns generated from this project.  The initial commits of this repo might not have much resembling to painting, but I'm hoping that by the end of this project it will.
